## 3. ‚öí Queries and Insights

### Task 1: Web performance analysis

- **Total visits** and **page views** are two **key metrics** to measure **the popularity of a website**. Higher total visits and higher page views indicate that more people visit the website and the content is attractive to audience.
- Since this is an e-commerce website, making visitors buying is the ultimate goal. Thus, the **number of transactions** is also an important metric to the business.


#### ‚öí Query 1.1: calculate total visit, page view, transaction by month
```sql 
SELECT 
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) AS month,
      SUM(totals.visits) AS total_visit,
      SUM(totals.pageviews) AS total_pageview,
      SUM(totals.transactions) AS total_transaction
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY month;
```
#### üëâüèª Results:

      <img width="400" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2ed18ee-6315-40d1-b7cd-4d19237387ef" />
</p>

- **Total visits** and **total page views** are relatively **stable** across the first seven months in 2017.

<p align="center">
      <img width="400" height="250" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04418dc6-ae6d-4d63-b58b-ac3f371c9724" />
</p>

- The number of **transactions** experiences an **upward trend** during the observed period. May has the highest number of transactions at 1160.

### Task 2: Revenue analysis

#### ‚öí Query 2.1: Revenue by traffic source
```sql
SELECT 
      trafficSource.source,
      SUM(p.productRevenue/1000000) AS total_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
      unnest(hits) hits,
      unnest(product) AS p
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
#### üëâüèª Results:

<p align='center'>
     <img width="387" height="159" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b565df6b-57f2-4493-ba3a-1e6b6f454304" />
</p>

#### üîé Insights:

- **Direct source** brings the **highest revenue**, at over **$708.000**, to the business, while **Google and Google Mail** are the next two important traffic sources at around **$166.000 and $12.262** respectively.
- **DoubleClick For Advertisers (dfa)** is an old brand name for Google Marketing Platform. If a session's traffic source is labeled as dfa, the exact traffic source is not identified. Hence, the total revenue coming from dfa delivers no meaningful information.

<br>

#### ‚öí Query 2.2: Revenue per session by traffic source
- **Revenue per session (RPS)** is a **key performance metric** in web analytics.
- It informs: "**How much revenue, on average, do you make from each session (visit) to your site?**"

```sql
SELECT 
      trafficSource.source,
      SUM(p.productRevenue/1000000)/SUM(totals.visits) AS total_revenue
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
      unnest(hits) hits,
      unnest(product) AS p
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
#### üëâüèª Results:
<p align='center'>
      <img width="388" height="164" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/348a75f4-bcc7-4014-b242-856366d96e93" />
</p>

#### üîé Insights:
- **AOL Mail, Dealspotr and Google Mail** have the **highest revenue generated per session**.
- Even though **AOL Mail** and **Dealspotr** do not have high total revenues, each visitor coming from these two sources **spends more money** than others.

---
### Task 3: User engagement analysis 
- User engagement is how users engage with the website. In e-commerce context, great user engagement indicates that users are interested in products and intend to buy something.
- Key metrics to measure user engagement in e-commerce:
  + **Bounce rate**: whether visitor leave or stay in the website after viewing the landing page.
  + **Session duration**: how much time a visitor spends on the website.
  + **Pages per session**: how many pages a visitor views. 
  + **Conversion rates**: the percentage of visitors completing a desired action out of total visitors.


#### ‚öí Query 3.1: Bounce rate per traffic source
- **Bounce rate** is a metric to measure **user engagement**.
- It is the **percentage of site vistors who leave after viewing only one page** without taking any further action. 
- Higher bounce rate is undesireable, indicating that many visitors leave after viewing the landing page. There are several causes leading to high bounce rate:
  + Slow page speed
  + Visitors' concern is irrelevant to the content.
  + The visual and/or content of the landing page is not attractive.
  + The website is not compatible with the device.
  
```sql
SELECT 
      trafficSource.source,
      COUNT(totals.visits) AS total_visit,
      COUNT(totals.bounces) AS total_no_of_bounce,
      ROUND((COUNT(totals.bounces))*100.0/COUNT(totals.visits),3) AS bounce_rate
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
GROUP BY trafficSource.source
ORDER BY total_visit DESC;
```

#### üëâüèª Results:
<p align='center'>
     <img width="635" height="378" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a0cf62c-11a8-467f-816c-c5349291048b" />
</p>

#### üîé Insights:
- Considering traffic sources with above 1000 total visits, **Twitter (t.co), Youtube and Baidu** have the **highest bounce rates** at **70%, 68.2% and 68%** respectively. 
- Sources generating high revenues such as **Direct source, Google and Google Mail** have relatively **low bounce rates** in the range of 37% to 45%.

<br>

#### ‚öí Query 3.2: Average number of page views by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers) 
- Classifying visitors into purchaser and non-purchaser groups is useful to explore any differences in their behavior.
- Insights are helpful to come up with solutions to convert non-purchasers to purchasers. 

```sql
WITH raw_table AS
      (SELECT 
            FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
            fullVisitorID,
            totals.transactions AS transaction_num,
            p.productRevenue AS revenue,
            totals.pageviews
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
            UNNEST(hits) hits,
            UNNEST(product) AS p
      WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
      )
, purchaser AS (
      SELECT 
            month,
            SUM(pageviews)/COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorID) AS avg_pageviews_purchaser
      FROM raw_table
      WHERE revenue IS NOT NULL AND transaction_num >= 1
      GROUP BY month
)
, non_purchaser AS (
      SELECT 
            month,
            SUM(pageviews)/COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorID) AS avg_pageviews_non_purchaser
      FROM raw_table
      WHERE revenue IS NULL AND transaction_num IS NULL
      GROUP BY month
)
SELECT 
      purchaser.month,
      purchaser.avg_pageviews_purchaser,
      non_purchaser.avg_pageviews_non_purchaser
FROM purchaser 
JOIN non_purchaser
ON purchaser.month = non_purchaser.month
ORDER BY purchaser.month;
```

#### üëâüèª Results:
<p align='center'>
      <img width="659" height="216" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/56cf5e86-463a-419c-9f4f-12eac5572f14" />
</p>

#### üîé Insights:
- **Non-purchasers** consistently view **2.5 to 4 times more pages** than those who do.
- The gap is consistent across months, showing that it is a **structural behavior**.
- **More page views** are **not always desireable**. In this case, more page views reflect **confusion or dissatisfaction** since visitors **can't find the products** they want even when they browse many pages.

<br>
  
#### ‚öí Query 3.3: Average amount of time per session by purchaser type (purchasers vs non-purchasers)

```sql
WITH raw_table AS
      (SELECT 
            FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
            fullVisitorID,
            totals.transactions AS transaction_num,
            p.productRevenue AS revenue,
            totals.timeOnSite AS duration
      FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
            UNNEST(hits) hits,
            UNNEST(product) AS p
      WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
      )
, purchaser AS (
      SELECT 
            month,
            SUM(duration)/COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorID) AS avg_duration_purchaser
      FROM raw_table
      WHERE revenue IS NOT NULL AND transaction_num >= 1
      GROUP BY month
)
, non_purchaser AS (
      SELECT 
            month,
            SUM(duration)/COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorID) AS avg_duration_non_purchaser
      FROM raw_table
      WHERE revenue IS NULL AND transaction_num IS NULL
      GROUP BY month
)
SELECT 
      purchaser.month,
      purchaser.avg_duration_purchaser,
      non_purchaser.avg_duration_non_purchaser
FROM purchaser 
JOIN non_purchaser
ON purchaser.month = non_purchaser.month
ORDER BY purchaser.month;
```
#### üëâüèª Results:
<p align='center'>
      <img width="619" height="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cf166c0a-5e46-4d1a-ab60-24b9894c52e7" />
</p>

#### üîé Insights:
- Consistent with the insight from query 3.2, **non-purchasers spend more time** within a session compared to purchasers.
- Purchasers are decisive. Once they found the desired products, they completed the purchase and finished the session.
- Non-purchasers spend more time to browse and find desired products.

<br>
  
#### ‚öí Query 3.4: Average number of transactions per user that made a purchase
```sql
SELECT 
      FORMAT_DATE('%Y-%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d', date)) AS month,
      SUM(totals.transactions)/COUNT(DISTINCT fullVisitorID) AS avg_transaction
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`,
      UNNEST(hits) hits,
      UNNEST(product) AS p
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
AND totals.transactions >= 1 AND p.productRevenue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY month;
```
#### üëâüèª Results:
<p align='center'>
      <img width="416" height="215" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e3a59338-dc0e-4217-8a82-59d00c2c8fe1" />
</p>

#### üîé Insights:
- The average number of transactions per purchaser is **relatively stable** around **3.5 transactions** in most months.
- **March** is the **exception** when the average number reached the **peak at 8.6 transactions**. 
- **July** also shows **better-than-average** results, with **4.1 transactions** per purchaser..

<br>

#### ‚öí Query 3.5: Calculate conversion rates from "view product" to "add to cart" and "purchase"
- **Conversion rate** is the percentage of visitors completing a desired action out of total visitors.
- **Viewing product, adding to cart and completing purchase** are three important steps in a **customer journey**. Transitioning from **"view product" to "add to cart"** indicates that users are **interested in product** and **intend to buy** it. Moving to **"purchase"** indicates that products provided by the company satisfy the needs of customers. In other words, there is a **product-market fit**.
- Tracking conversion rates across the customer journey is useful to **identify frictions** (e.g slow checkout, unsuitable payment methods) which cause drop-outs. Solving frictions can **improve user experience** and **boost final purchases**.
  
```sql
WITH product_data AS(
SELECT
    FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', PARSE_DATE('%Y%m%d',date)) AS month,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN eCommerceAction.action_type = '2' THEN product.v2ProductName END) AS num_product_view,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN eCommerceAction.action_type = '3' THEN product.v2ProductName END) AS num_add_to_cart,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN eCommerceAction.action_type = '6' and product.productRevenue is not null THEN product.v2ProductName END) AS num_purchase
FROM `bigquery-public-data.google_analytics_sample.ga_sessions_2017*`
    ,UNNEST(hits) AS hits
    ,UNNEST (hits.product) AS product
WHERE _table_suffix BETWEEN '0101' AND '0731'
AND eCommerceAction.action_type IN ('2','3','6')
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month
)

SELECT
    *,
    ROUND(num_add_to_cart/num_product_view * 100, 2) AS add_to_cart_rate,
    ROUND(num_purchase/num_product_view * 100, 2) AS purchase_rate
FROM product_data;
```

#### üëâüèª Results:
<p align='center'>
      <img width="882" height="214" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d8c08e8e-4151-4020-9779-53710ca2072a" />
</p>

#### üí° Insights:
- **Conversion performance** has **consistently improved** across months.
- The conversion rate from **"view product" to "add to cart"** has experienced **upward trend** from **28.47%** in January to **41.5%** in July. **April** reached the **peak at 41.86%**. That indicates **improved user engagement** and **interests in products** over time.  
- Similarly, the conversion rate from **"view product" to "complete purchase"** has seen **upward trend** from **8.31%** in January to **12.84%** in July. **May** reached the **highest** conversion rate to "complete purchase" at **12.9%**. That shows a **strong improvement**, suggesting **better product-market fit** or **optimized purchase funnel**.

</p>

#### üîé Insights:
- **Maze Pen** and **Google Sunglasses** **dominate** monthly top sales. **Maze Pen** is the top-selling product **3 out of 7 months**: **January, March and June**. **Google Sunglasses** is also the top-selling product in **April, May and July**.
- **Recycled Mouse Pad** is the top-selling product only in **February**, possibly because of a **special marketing campaign**.
- **May** has the **lowest sales** for the top-selling product. It could indicate **seasonal low** or **product fatique**.

<br> 

#### Query 4.2: Which products are often purchased with Maze Pen and Google Sunglasses?
- Since Maze Pen and Google Sunglasses frequently dominate monthly sales, exploring which products are often purchased with them can make better cross-sell strategies.
